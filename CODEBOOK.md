### Variables in the tidy dataset

Except the first two, all other variables in the tidy dataset are numeric.
Variable 1, [Activity] is a string that can take 6 values:
* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING

The numbers correspond to the different values in the raw data

Variable 2, [Subject] is the identifier for the subjects 1 to 30 that were part of the study.

From the raw data, the variables containing "mean" and "std" in the name (for average and standard deviation values)
of the variables were copied into the intermediate data.
From these rows in the intermediate data, the average for each of these variables was calculated, per subject, per activity.

For each subject and activity, the tidy data contains the mean of the values from the selected variables in raw data.

The remaining variables of the type numeric are:
* tBodyAcc.mean.X
* tBodyAcc.mean.Y
* tBodyAcc.mean.Z
* tBodyAcc.std.X
* tBodyAcc.std.Y
* tBodyAcc.std.Z
* tGravityAcc.mean.X
* tGravityAcc.mean.Y
* tGravityAcc.mean.Z
* tGravityAcc.std.X
* tGravityAcc.std.Y
* tGravityAcc.std.Z
* tBodyAccJerk.mean.X
* tBodyAccJerk.mean.Y
* tBodyAccJerk.mean.Z
* tBodyAccJerk.std.X
* tBodyAccJerk.std.Y
* tBodyAccJerk.std.Z
* tBodyGyro.mean.X
* tBodyGyro.mean.Y
* tBodyGyro.mean.Z
* tBodyGyro.std.X
* tBodyGyro.std.Y
* tBodyGyro.std.Z
* tBodyGyroJerk.mean.X
* tBodyGyroJerk.mean.Y
* tBodyGyroJerk.mean.Z
* tBodyGyroJerk.std.X

* fBodyBodyAccJerkMag.mean
* fBodyBodyAccJerkMag.std
* fBodyBodyGyroMag.mean
* fBodyBodyGyroMag.std
* fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag.mean
* fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag.std

### So what are these variables?
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. 
These are used on the angle() variable:
* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals and copied to the intermediate data are: 
* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation

### Converting raw data into tidy data
Using software development best practices, I have written detailed comments explaining each step of the data transformation.
These comments are included in the file run_analysis.R uploaded onto GitHub.
